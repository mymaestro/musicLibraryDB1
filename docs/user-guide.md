## Librarian instructions

#### Part 1: Music information
1. Sign in to the library at https://allanacrusis.net Confirm that you have librarian access.
2. Select MATERIALS → Compositions to enter the Compositions page.
3. Enter all or part of the title, composer, or arranger of your piece in the search field, and choose Search to find your piece in the library list. Choose the blue EDIT button.

**On the edit screen:**

a. Confirm that the catalog number matches what appears on the folder. The number in the catalog should be a letter followed by three numbers (C###, M###, or X###) even if the folder has fewer numbers. If necessary, add zeroes to the front of the number to make it three digits.

b. Confirm that Enabled is selected, so that the piece appears in searches and selections.

c. Confirm the Title of the piece, including the spelling. Articles should follow the title, separated by a comma; e.g. Liberty Bell, The. This is true for both English articles (a, an, the) and non-English articles (la, le, les, los, die, der, etc.).

d. Confirm the Composer, Arranger, and Editor names are correct. Family names should be listed first, followed by given names. If names or parts of names are missing, please add them. NOTE: Composer is a required field. If no composer is listed on a piece, enter Traditional or (n/a), whichever seems more accurate. Arranger and Editor fields can be left blank if the piece does not have them.

e. Confirm or add the Publisher. You can generally drop words like Inc, Publisher, Company, and such. For example, Hal Leonard Corporation can be listed just as Hal Leonard.

f. Select the Genre from the drop-down menu. For most pieces, you will use one of the following:
   - Wind Ensemble—for most general band pieces
   - Symphonic Transcription—for pieces originally written for orchestra
   - March—for marches
   - Christmas—for holiday music
   - Pop/Show Tunes (as appropriate)—for band versions of popular or Broadway/movie songs
   - Solo with band accompaniment—for solos

If it's not clear what genre is appropriate, go with Wind Ensemble.

g. Confirm that the Ensemble box says Fourth Wind Wind Ensemble. You should not encounter any exceptions to this.

h. Consult the piece's score to see if it lists Grade level (sometimes called difficult, should be a number between 1 and 7) or Duration. If neither is listed in the score, check the Wind Repertory Project site (https://www.windrep.org) for the information. You can also use the Wind Repertory Project link button at the bottom of the Edit screen. In either case, please confirm that you are looking at the correct edition for the piece. Check the arranger's name and/or publisher if necessary. Enter the grade and duration in the correct fields. If neither is available, leave blank.

i. Select the Paper Size from the drop-down menu. Most band music is printed on Folio paper (9x12), but some are on Letter (8.5x11) or Marching band paper.

j. Choose Update to save your changes.

#### Part 2: Instrumentation
1. On the search screen, find your piece again. This time, choose Instrumentation to access the Enter Instrumentation screen.
2. Confirm that the Catalog number, title, and paper size are correct.
3. In the Page count field, enter the average number of pages for each part in the piece. For example, if each part is only one page like most marches, enter 1. This does not have to be exact. Just take a look at a few parts and estimate the average. You can update the number of pages in individual parts later.
4. In the Instrument Parts box, select ALL of the parts that appear in the piece. There are a couple of ways to get this information:
   - Check the front of the score. Many pieces have the instrumentation listed there.
   - Go through the parts in the folder and enter all of the parts. Most pieces should have a set of file copies pulled together; if that is the case you can just use the file copies to get the instrumentation. If there isn't a file copies set, you may have to look through the parts individually. (But feel free to pull together a file copies set while you're doing that. Jarred is happy to give you tips on how to do that.)

To select multiple parts at once, hold down the Control key as you click.
Try to select parts from the list whose names match what's on the music. If you have a part that does not appear in the list, let Jarred or Warren know and they will add it. This can be especially tricky with percussion parts.
Once you have selected all parts, choose Add parts.

5. Choose MATERIALS > Parts from the menu at the top of the page.
6. Find your piece in the list (they are listed in catalog number order) and choose the title to see the list of parts. Check the list to be sure it is correct.
7. For each part in the list, choose the blue Edit button.
   
   a. Check that the Pages and Paper size fields reflect the number and size of pages for that part.
   
   b. For every part you actually have in the folder, enter 1 in the Originals Count field. If any part is supposed to be there but is missing, enter 0 in that field. [The 1 should be in place by default, but check the parts to be sure.]
   
   c. Enter any name or description if needed. For example if the original has many annotations (pen/pencil marks), is deckle-edged or torn, or has pages missing, enter that in the description.
   
   d. Add the instrument(s) on the part to the instruments list. Usually, the default (noted with an asterisk) is already added, and correct. For parts—most likely percussion—that include multiple instruments not reflected in the part name, [This is most common for parts labeled Percussion 1, Mallet Percussion, Auxiliary Percussion, or the like.] add all the instruments that appear on the part to the instruments list. If a part has two of the same instrument (for example Flute 1 & 2), add the same instrument to the list, so that it appears on the list twice. To select multiple instruments at once, hold down the Control key as you click.

Optionally, in the Description field, enter the instruments that appear on the part (snare drum, bass drum, crash cymbals, etc.). Sometimes these parts will be listed at the top of the part with the Percussion label. Sometimes you'll have to look through the part to find the instruments. If you have any questions, ask Jarred, Warren, or a percussionist.

8. Choose Update to save your changes.
